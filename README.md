Alice to Koha
=============

This repository contains a collection of Perl scripts that are useful when
migrating from Softlink's Alice ILS to [Koha](https://koha-community.org/).

Note: the scripts in this repository contain many parts that are specific
to the data at the International English Library, where they were developed.
You will not be able to use them as a drop-in migration solution. However, it
is hoped that this repository will be a useful starting point for anyone else
doing the same migration.
